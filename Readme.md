#NOTE: 
For dataring, we only work with the native folder currently. The files for implementing and testing new features of our cryptosystem in dataring are ecelgamal.h, ecelgamal.c and testing.cpp!!!

# EC-ElGamal

This repository contains a C implementation of the additive homomorphic elliptic curve based EL-Gamal cryptographic scheme and a corresponding Java JNI wrapper. The elliptic curve operations of OpenSSL are used for the implementation.
Ciphertexts can be added toghether such that the decrypted result corresponds to the sum of the plaintexts (i.e. p1 + p2 = Dec(Enc(p1) ++ Enc(p2)))) similar to the Paillier-cryptosystem.


## Content 
The *native* folder contains the C implementation of the scheme and the *src* folder contains the Java wrapper library.

### Prerequisites 
Make sure you have the following installed:
 * [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
 * [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/source/)
 * [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
 * Java JDK 1.8
 * Boost C++ Libraries (http://www.boost.org)

### C Library
The C library contains two versions of EC-Elgamal, a basic version and a Chinese Remainder Thereom (CRT) based optimized version, as introduced by [Pilatus](http://www.vs.inf.ethz.ch/publ/papers/mshafagh_SenSys17_Pilatus.pdf). The library builds with cmake. To compile the library and run the benchmark run: 

```
cd native
cmake .
make
./out/ecelgamal
```


### Java Wrapper
The Java library wraps the CRT based EC-ElGamal scheme implemented in C in a Java class with the JNI. The Java wrapper contains a prebuilt version of the library for linux64 and darwin64 (src/main/resources).
To build the jar package, maven is required. The following command builds the library:

```
mvn package
```
Here an example on how to use the library.
```java
ECElGamal.CRTParams params32 = ECElGamal.getDefault32BitParams();
ECElGamal.ECElGamalKey key32 = ECElGamal.generateNewKey(params32)
ECElGamal.ECElGamalCiphertext cipher1,cipher2;
int val1 = 2, val2 = -3;
cipher1 = ECElGamal.encrypt(BigInteger.valueOf(val1), key32);
cipher2 = ECElGamal.encrypt(BigInteger.valueOf(val2), key32);
cipher1 = ECElGamal.add(cipher1, cipher2);
int decriptedVal = ECElGamal.decrypt32(cipher1, key32);
assertEquals(val1 + val2, decriptedVal);
```
